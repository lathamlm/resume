### About Me:

Hello! My name is Leah Latham.  I am 31 years old and am currently in Vanderbilt University's Data Analytics Boot Camp set to graduate in November 2023.  I have worked in healthcare for the past nine years, first as a Registered Nurse and then as an RN Quality Coordinator at a Level-1 trauma center.  A love of all things data has led me become a Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality in 2020 and then to pursue data analytics and data science.
